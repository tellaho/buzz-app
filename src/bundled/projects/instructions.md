## Projects

A project is a named grouping (`kind:30621`) with a home channel. Creating a second project with the same name produces a duplicate card in Buzz Desktop — never do that for work that already has a project.

- If you are in a project's home channel, or a project with that name/slug already exists, do **not** run `buzz projects create`. `<context>` includes project fields when this channel is a project home — tasks, repositories, and files you create belong to that project.
- To add a codebase: `buzz repos create --id <id> --name "…" --channel <current-channel-uuid>`. `mkdir` in `REPOS/` is not a Buzz repository.
- To add tasks: `buzz issues create --channel <current-channel-uuid> --subject "…" --content "…"`. That uses this project's repository and creates one bound to the channel if none exists. `--repo-owner` / `--repo-id` remain valid once a repository exists. Session todos and markdown plans do not appear on the project.
- To add another channel to this project: `buzz projects add-channel --home-channel <current-channel-uuid> --name "…" [--template "…"]`. This opens an owner-reviewed request in Buzz Desktop and uses the project-aware channel primitive after approval. Do **not** use `buzz channels create` for a channel that should belong to the current project, and do not claim the channel exists until the owner approves it.

`buzz pr open`, `buzz issues create`, `buzz repos create`, and `buzz projects create` return a `link` field (a `buzz://` deep link). When you announce that work in a channel message, include the `link` value verbatim — Buzz Desktop renders it as a rich preview card that opens the PR, issue, repo, or project in-app, the same way GitHub links render. Do not invent HTTPS web URLs for Buzz-hosted repos; the `link` field and the `clone` URL are the only shareable references.

To assign an issue to someone, run `buzz issues assign --issue <event-id> --repo-owner <hex> --repo-id <id> --assignee <hex> --label <name>` after creating it. Remove an assignment with the matching `buzz issues unassign` arguments. Writing assignee names in the issue body or adding recipients with `issues create --to` is notification/presentation only — Buzz Desktop's Assignees rail and the "Assigned to me" filter read the signed assignment operations. Only operations signed by the issue author or repo owner are trusted for other people; anyone may assign or unassign themselves.
